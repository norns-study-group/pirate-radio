# first time starting

the first time you start the *pirate radio* it will take a minute. it will first install nessecary linux tools if not already installed (`vorbis-tools`, `espeak`, `ffmpeg` and `lame`). afterwards it will download available playlists for the different stations.

# uploading your own music

goto [coffer.norns.online/](https://coffer.norns.online/) to upload your own tracks. simply select a station and choose the files. optionally you can add some information about the artist or other info.

# listening to the radio

once the radio is initiated, you'll see a dial. use **E3 to move the dial**. once you hit upon a station you should see the frequency get brigther and the magic eye get smaller. some stations also have some graphics that will appear.

once the radio station is dialed in you should stop hearing radio static and start hearing the radio.

to make a loop, **press K2 twice to set start and end points**. once a loop is created, you **press K2 to deletel loop**. 

**press K3 once to get back to "live" audio**.

rotating **E2 will slow down and speed up time**. rotating **E3 will change position in time**. as of now, you cannot go into a time in the future.

use the norns TAPE to record your remixed audio.

## effects

in addition to the normal compressor and reverb available on the norns, there are other effects available to add to the pirate radio. go into the parameters menu and you will see delay and granulator effects:
